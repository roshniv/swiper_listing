Clone the Job Listing repo using following command "git clone https://github.com/roshniv/swiper_listing.git"
Change the directory to swiper_listing "cd swiper_listing"
install all the dependencies "npm install"
build the project "npm run build"
open src/client/index.html on any of the browser. It will have all changes for the movie listing.
Architecture: The complete page is divided into small components and has been built keeping in mind that these components can be generic and re-usable and should be able to consume any other json file for data. Firstly, the page is devided into following sections: (i) Container (ii) Movie Content Listing (iii) Movie Carousel

Responsiveness: The pages are responsive and should work fine across all browsers.

Let me know if you see any issues.

Cheers, Roshni
